<h1>Porpoise</h1>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<h3>This website captures the importance of Porpoises and their unique abilities. 
It explores the endangerment of them and how to put a stop to it.</h3>


  


<h2>Vaquita</h2>
<h3>The Vaquita Porpoises are critically endangered. 
There are only about 30 left in the wild.
Fishermen (and women) that fish using gill nets sometimes catch porpoises who are trying to simply
 catch themselves a dinner and get the porpoises killed due to them drowning in the nets.
 A few years ago there were 600 Vaquitas left in the wild but the poputation has dropped dirasticly.
  The Vaquita is the most endangered porpoise out of them all yet sadly, one of the cutest.
  The Vaquita looks strangely like they are wearing black lipstick and black eyeliner!
 I hope you learned something about the Vaquita Porpose!</h3>
<h2>Fun Fact </h2> <h3>The name Vaquita means Little Cow.</h3>

  <h2>Harbor</h2>
<h3>The Harbor Porpoise (aka the common porpoise) is probably the most common species of porpoise. 
They live in the temprate costal waters of the Northern Hemisphere.
 Once they were considereda delacacy upon royals. 
 I'm just glad it was a delacacy other than a common meat, 
 if so, every species of Porpoise would probably be extinct!
  The Harbor Porpoise can grow up to six feet maximum.
  I hope that you enjoyed learning about the Harbor Porpoise!</h3>

<h2>Fun Fact</h2> <h3>It is one of the smallest marine animals!</h3>

<h2>Finless</h2> <h3>The Finless Porpoise (hence the name) dosen't have a dorsal fin,
 making it the only species of porpoise that lacks this. 
The Finless Porpoise is the most rooted member of the porpoise family.
 They look very graceful and agile as if they are dancing!
 They live in China around the Yangtze River.
 I hope that you enjoyed learning about the Finless Porpoise!</h3>
<h2>Fun Fact</h2> <h3>There is a total of 1000 Finless Porpoise individauls.</h3>
